JavaScript Reduce Exercise:

This repository contains a set of JavaScript functions that utilize the reduce array method. 
These exercises cover various scenarios, including extracting values, counting vowels, adding key-value pairs to objects, and partitioning arrays based on a callback.

Instructions-

1. Clone the Repository:

2. Open index.html in a Browser:

   Double-click on the index.html file or open it using a web browser.

3. Check Console Output:

   Open the browser's developer tools and navigate to the console tab.

4. Explore the Functions:

   The JavaScript code in script.js contains implementations for various functions.
   Functions are named according to their respective exercises (e.g., extractValue, vowelCount, addKeyAndValue, partition).

5. Review Console Output:

   After opening the HTML file, review the console output to see the results of each function.

Exercise Descriptions-

1. extractValue

   Function: extractValue

   Description: Extracts the values of a specified key from an array of objects using reduce.

   Example Output Console: [25, 30, 22]

2. vowelCount

   Function: vowelCount

   Description: Counts the occurrences of vowels in a string and returns an object using reduce.

   Example Output Console: { 'e': 1, 'o': 2 }

3. addKeyAndValue

   Function: addKeyAndValue

   Description: Adds a key-value pair to each object in an array of objects using reduce.

   Example Output Console: An array of objects with the added key-value pair.

4. partition

   Function: partition

   Description: Partitions an array into two subarrays based on the result of a callback function using reduce.

   Example Output Console: An array with two subarrays.

Explore and Learn-

Feel free to explore the code, modify function parameters, and observe the changes in the console output. 
This exercise is designed to help you understand and practice working with the reduce array method in JavaScript.
